# 👨‍💻 Aaron Espinosa  

Welcome! I'm Aaron, a **Data Scientist** with a strong **software engineering background**, currently working in **Data Analytics & Consulting at RSM**. I focus on solving real-world problems at the intersection of **data, systems, and business decisions**.

🔍 **What I do**  
- Transform data into **actionable insights** using **Python**, **SQL**, **EDA**, and **Machine Learning**.  
- Work on **data-driven projects in real business environments**, bridging analysis with decision-making.  
- Build efficient and robust software solutions, backed by a solid foundation in **C/C++** and rigorous, project-based **engineering** training at 42.  
- Communicate complex ideas through **clean analysis and clear visualizations**.

💡 **What drives me**  
I enjoy understanding how systems work under the hood—data pipelines, software, or processes—and making them **simpler, sharper, and more useful**.

📍 **Where I’m based**  
Barcelona, Spain — working with a global and consulting-oriented mindset.

💬 **Let’s connect**  
Always open to good conversations around data, tech, and building things that actually work.
